            For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final
            computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third-party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

            For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final
            computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third-party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.
